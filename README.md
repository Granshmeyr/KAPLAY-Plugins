## KAPLAY-Plugins

***TODO***: Create documentation describing the usage of my existing plugins. Also for how to create a plugin.

A collection of plugins used for games I develop in the [KAPLAY](https://kaplayjs.com/) game library.

- **grindleBundle** - Used to create bundle factories, which instantiate collections of comps. These act as contracts to describe entities.
- **grindleComp** - Tools to create custom comps and work with them.
- **grindleConst** - Common `const` values.
- **grindleDebug** -Functions to help debug.
- **grindleMath** - Mathematical functions that have manifested from common challenges.
- **grindleSprite** - Functions to help manage sprite configurations and load from them.
- **grindleSvgMove** - Instantiate a controller to move objects along an SVG path.
- **grindleTiled** - Parse a `.tmj` file into a `GameObj` representation.
- **grindleUtil** - Functions for occasional, general tasks.
